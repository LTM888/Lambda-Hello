My name is Leigh Martin and I am from Columbia, South Carolina. 
Three words that would descried me would be patience, fun, and easygoing. 
My two favorite hobby I would have to say are traveling and photography, 
I am just learning how to take my camera off of auto mode. 
I also love to cook healthy alternatives to my favorite junk food.
